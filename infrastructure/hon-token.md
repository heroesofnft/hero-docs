# Hon Token

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Logo1-Neon (1).svg>)

Literally the first Avalanche Native cross-chain token. With 200 M total supply, Hon can be used in Avalanche C-chain as well as in X-chain. From the technical aspect the X-chain is superior to C-chain. Future uses of X-chain with the subnets enable the HON ecosystem to keep it's stability while increasing it's performance.

We believe in the future of Avalanche, so creating this kind of token will allow our users to become a part of rapidly evolving ecosystem.
