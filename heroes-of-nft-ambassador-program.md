## b) Ambassador Responsibilities

There will be monthly expectations from ambassadors. They will complete the requirements according to their skill sets to be eligible for compensation.

Establish, grow, and engage with digital communities

* Educate the public
* Develop bots and tools
* Translate texts
* Create visuals, documents, guidelines, and events

### The HON Council

Every new HON Ambassador will gain access to a separate and private Discord channel called the HON Council. This channel is designed to provide additional value to Ambassadors and give them more reason and desire for progress. In many ways, The Council is a place for feedback, voting, opinions, and insight from all within.

We hope that by bringing you into The Council, you will further champion the HON cause and develop a greater connection with the project due to how much influence your input can have. To add to that, Ambassadors gain a front-row seat to exclusive updates and developments before they go live, being the first to know about things like NFT upgrades and Land Sales.

### Ambassador of the Month&#x20;

Each month we will provide additional rewards to the Ambassador that has made the greatest strides, the most lauded contributions, and who has gone above and beyond in their role. Voted on by fellow Ambassadors, the Ambassador of the month will receive a @mention and praise on Twitter, as well as one of the following:

* Free NFT (HON NFT or an NFT collected through a collaboration)
* Discounted land plot - from the upcoming sale
* Token allocation - HON’s token or from a collab project
* Free mint allocation from other projects from PRO outreach

## c) Compensation

Whilst many people thirst for adventure alone, it’s only right that we are rewarded for our toil. To encourage brave contributors to join our journey, we offer a unique set of rewards.

### Performance-based payment&#x20;
